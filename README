This is a sample iOS application development about horizontal swipe
to change views.

With the use of UIPageControl and UIScrollView, this is made possible.

The application supports both portrait and landscape orientation.

P.S.
This code is messy, I know. If there are things needed to be changed,
please do not hesitate to contact me. I am open to suggestions.

Thank you!
